 					<h3> Artificial Intelligence </h3>
 					<p style="color: white;"> Artificial intelligence in games is usually used for creating player's opponents. Opposite to this, the objective of intelligence amplification is rescuing the player from the boredom of repetition and letting him focus just on the interesting aspects of the game. The player gives high-level strategic orders, the computer-controlled units take care of detail. At the same time, the full detail and dynamics of the game is maintained with the computer control of detail, rather than lost through abstraction. There are still bullets flying, rather than tiles shifting. In addition to this, intelligence amplification is fully applicable to multi-player games. <br> Let's illustrate this concept on an example of a tactical game. The player is in command of a number of squads, each composed of several individual soldiers. The player's orders refer to the whole squad, whereas the members of the squad choose and adjust the formation. Each individual member of the squad is intelligent, trying to maximize his efficiency and minimize his exposure. <br> 
					The player can give his squad two kinds of orders: explicit and implicit. Most games support only explicit orders: move, attack, guard, build, etc. Unlike explicit orders, implicit orders transmit information from the player to the units and assists them in making better autonomous decisions. For example, a player might want to inform his squad that he expects that opponents will approach from the east, rather than the west, by drawing an arrow of expected attack. Alternatively, the player might want to draw a circle where he expects the ambush. <br> Game playing was an area of research in AI from its inception. One of the first examples of AI is the computerised game of Nim made in 1951 and published in 1952. Despite being advanced technology in the year it was made, 20 years before Pong, the game took the form of a relatively small box and was able to regularly win games even against highly skilled players of the game. In 1951, using the Ferranti Mark 1 machine of the University of Manchester, Christopher Strachey wrote a checkers program and Dietrich Prinz wrote one for chess. These were among the first computer programs ever written. Arthur Samuel's checkers program, developed in the middle 50s and early 60s, eventually achieved sufficient skill to challenge a respectable amateur. Work on checkers and chess would culminate in the defeat of Garry Kasparov by IBM's Deep Blue computer in 1997. The first video games developed in the 1960s and early 1970s, like Spacewar!, Pong, and Gotcha (1973), were games implemented on discrete logic and strictly based on the competition of two players, without AI. <br>
					Games that featured a single player mode with enemies started appearing in the 1970s. The first notable ones for the arcade appeared in 1974: the Taito game Speed Race (racing video game) and the Atari games Qwak (duck hunting light gun shooter) and Pursuit (fighter aircraft dogfighting simulator). Two text-based computer games from 1972, Hunt the Wumpus and Star Trek, also had enemies. Enemy movement was based on stored patterns. The incorporation of microprocessors would allow more computation and random elements overlaid into movement patterns. Light cycle characters compete to be the last one riding, in GLtron. <br> 

 					<h3> Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality</h3>
 					<p style="color: whiteSSS"> The market for virtual reality technology is potentially vast, its applications are growing, and it's attracting money at a rapid clip. Hardware and software in the space will rake in an estimated $2.3 billion in revenue for 2015 worldwide, vs. $90 million in 2014, according to research data from Statista. By 2018, the firm expects sales of virtual reality products to reach $5.2 billion. No surprise, then, that companies like Facebook, Google and Intel are investing. </p> <br>

 					<p style=" color: white;"> Facebook acquired VR headset developer Oculus in 2014. Its Oculus Rift headset is scheduled to launch in the first quarter of 2016. Google is already selling its smartphone-compatible Cardboard VR viewer, and it's developed apps to go with it. Intel has developed VR technology for Razer cameras that can be used as gaming controllers. Razer expects to launch them in early 2016. Also early next year, Sony is expected to release its VR undersea gaming experience, "The Deep," alongside its Project Morpheus headset launch. Tech companies aren't the only ones investing in VR. The New York Times, for example, launched a 3-D viewer in November. And at least one smaller firm has seen early success in virtual reality gaming. Crowd-funded VR game Star Citizen, developed by Roberts Space Industries, has raised well over $100 million in funds. "Virtual reality is a whole new medium," said Neville Spiteri, co-founder and CEO of Wevr, a company that helps people create content and share it with their audiences. "As a result, there's a whole new wave of creators, storytellers, writers, directors, game designers that are really intrigued by the new medium and are developing content for it." Facebook's Oculus has already worked with a former Pixar employee on virtual reality entertainment, which will be available to Oculus Rift users when that headset goes on sale. Of course there are more practical applications for virtual reality beyond entertainment. </p>
