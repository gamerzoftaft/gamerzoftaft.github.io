							<h4> FINAL FANTASY XII REVIEW</h4>
							<h5>BY HEIDI KEMPS</h5>
						<br>	
						<p>
						
The original Final Fantasy XII was a great game that came out at the wrong time. Launching on the PlayStation 2 distressingly close to the release of the PlayStation 3 and Wii meant that it was overlooked and underplayed by many. Those who did stick with it, however, were rewarded with a superb RPG adventure, filled with beautiful visuals, an engrossing world, and a unique free-roaming approach to exploration and combat. Now Final Fantasy XII is back as The Zodiac Age on PlayStation 4, polished with a high-definition coat of paint and a host of minor – but mostly positive – changes, giving players both old and new a second chance to experience the world of Ivalice.
Final Fantasy XII’s refreshingly down-to-earth story focuses on the struggles of characters caught up in a web of politics and war, rather than a stereotypical cataclysmic “saving the universe” sort of JRPG adventure. The focus on the characters and their small but important roles in a larger struggle makes the various twists, betrayals, and triumphs of the story feel more impactful. It’s helped along by one of the best localizations ever, which makes reading reams of dialogue learning more about the world feel rewarding on its own. This is a game where I thoroughly enjoy talking to each and every NPC, which is especially impressive when you consider that a playthrough can range from 60 hours to over 100, depending on your pace.

Final Fantasy XII’s relatable roleplaying adventure has aged remarkably well, and The Zodiac Age remaster improves it further in meaningful ways. The storytelling, visual design, and gameplay feel just as fresh and interesting as they did over a decade ago, and the various new enhancements and adjustments will give new players a chance to experience the magic for the first time and fans of the original something enticing to return for.
