							<h4> H1ZI: KING OF THE KILL REVIEW</h4>
							<h5> BY MARSHALL BENSON/h5>
						<br>	
							<p>
The game modes are consistent with the previous title featuring a solo, 2-team, and 5-team game types. I enjoyed that they kept the component that dying early doesn’t rob you of victory and rewards if your team still wins. However, playing as a team requires you to get into the top 3 instead of solo mode’s top 5 to receive rewards. Rewards still grant you permanent skins to apply to clothing. Additional skins and difficult-to-obtain competitive reward skins are sure to fulfill all of your fashionable desires. However, like any game currently on the market, micro-transactions are required in order to obtain many of these skins. I was thoroughly disappointed in the rewards chests with purchasable keys. This money grabs scheme screams micro-transactions at the top of its greedy lungs and it’s infuriating. No, thank you. Being #1 out of 150 players should be greatly rewarded.
				<p>
King of the Kill’s strengths lies heavily in the limitless scenarios you and your friends will encounter fighting other players. Getting a team together to ride around in a cop car with the siren roaring looking for enemies is hard to beat. Whether my friends and I were roaming the streets of Pleasant Valley or camping out in a bathroom waiting for others to perish, we were constantly laughing. This game is one of the most fun experiences I have had playing with friends in a long time. At times, we were laughing so hard we could not focus and were sent to early graves (adding further to the laughter). King of the Kill became immensely more fun when played with friends, and I recommend finding a partner to play with for some great laughs and moments. Despite all of the problems in its early access stage, H1Z1: King of the Kill is definitely worth its $19.99 sale price on Steam.
